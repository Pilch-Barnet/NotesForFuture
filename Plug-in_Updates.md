# Steps for weekly plugin updates

This is really quick and simple but I just wanted a list for the Event Calenders that have to be check after the updates.

## ManageWP

+ In the Updates frame while on the plugins tab **check** Select all then **hit** the Update button
  ++ Be careful about updating the rest of the tabs on this frame
+ In the Optimization frame while on the MB Overhead tab **check** Select all then **hit** the Update button
+ Make sure all of the updates, well updated. There might be a few warnings in the message center of a few that did not(looking at you Middleton)
+ *Possibly go and check all the dashboard and make sure nothing odd is happening*

## List of the sites that use the event calender

+ Middleton
+ Boulder Junction
+ Vilas
+ Tomahawk
+ Rusk

## Places that are not on ManageWP

+ Porcupine
